My name is Mark Nielsen and I am a Statistician currently working in the healthcare industry.  I have a passion for statistics, programming, guitar, technology, mountain biking and most of all, being a dad. I graduated with a Masters in Statistics in 2011 and have since worked several years in the banking industry and several years in healthcare.
